            <h2>About you</h2>

            <p>We're looking for an excellent Next.js/React engineer, with experience designing and building large, consumer facing applications for a wide audience. The ideal person would:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Be able to build the front end for a large, consumer focused web application themselves</li>
                <li>Be confident creating a product used by thousands of people</li>
                <li>Be able to make that application performant, accessible and beautiful</li>
                <li>Be a strong communicator, able to express and work through complex technical issues clearly with a team</li>
                <li>Be able to contribute on the backend where necessary</li>
            </ul>

            <p>We are a small team with a lot to do, so the ideal candidate won't mind getting stuck into the highest priority engineering problems to make the product a success.</p>
        
            <h2>Technologies & skills</h2>
            <p>As a technical co-founder you'll have significant input on the technologies we use, but we would expect that the right candidate would have significant React expertise, as well as experience with:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>TypeScript</li>
                <li>CSS3 or a suitable styling framework</li>
                <li>Responsive website development & web accessibility</li>
                <li>Experience with technical SEO</li>
                <li>Experience with Next.js strongly preferred</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>
                Apply with a CV and optional covering message to <a href="mailto:jobs@swinton.dev">jobs@swinton.dev</a>. Do apply even if you don't meet every single qualification. We're looking for the best possible person, not the longest CV. We'll consider applications on a rolling basis, so apply now rather than later.
